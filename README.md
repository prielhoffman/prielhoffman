**' Communication Systems Engineering Graduate '**

Graduated with a bachelor's degree in communication systems engineering at Ben-Gurion University, with a strong foundation in programming, communication protocols, algorithms and signal processing. At Elta Systems I conducted a final project which is a kind of practical research that compared the performance of receiver types, using MATLAB simulations, independent research and detailed documentation to draw influential conclusions. Proficient in MATLAB, C, C++ and Python, I am keen to apply the knowledge I have gained during my degree and work experience to drive innovation and make a meaningful impact.
