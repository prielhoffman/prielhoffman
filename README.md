## Priel Hoffman ☺️

**`Communication Systems Engineer`**

My name is Priel, and I'm currently seeking an entry-level role as a communication systems engineer or software engineer.

I graduated from Ben Gurion University with a major in Communication Systems Engineering. While at Ben Gurion University, I established and grew my passion for communication protocols, programming, and algorithms. Some of the courses that fascinated me the most were Computer Networks, where I first learned to understand and analyze communication protocols and explored their practical applications in laboratory classes. Another course that captured my interest was Wireless Communication, where I studied how wireless and satellite communication work, delving into the Physical layer, MAC protocols, and recent standards, both in lectures and through hands-on laboratory experience. Additionally, I enjoyed Computer Science and Systems Programming, where I developed my skills in C/C++ and Python programming. I was also drawn to courses related to algorithms, where I enjoyed the challenge of finding effective solutions to complex problems.
